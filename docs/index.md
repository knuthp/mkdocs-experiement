# Welcome to MkDocs

These pages are to experiment with mkdocs and github. My plan is to moved my technical stuff from Google Sites 

(I did not like the new site generator and does not care to make it pretty when converted)

## What I want to learn
1. mkdocs - create nice looking articles/documentation 
    * how create pages, 
    * menus and navigation 
    * toc
1. mkdocs-material - a nice theme that also fast-api is using with appealing design
1. github - refresh and extend knowledge
    * Creating repository, push/pull and vscode support locally
    * github actions - Last time I tried it was Travis
    * github-pages - Hosting documentation should be easy
1. github vscode - Edit pages in the browser
    * Google sites was easy to access from any computer
1. poetry and github
    * How to structure and use poetry with github
